While the C ORB Interface has been used to implement and communicate 
with CORBA objects, it should still be considered a prototype.   
Currently, the C functions generated by corbin-idl are compiled 
into a static library and linked into the SML/NJ runtime system.  
Future work could involve modifying corbin-idl to work with a 
dynamic, shared library in order to avoid re-compilation of the 
entire SML/NJ runtime system.

Since corbin-idl has been implemented in ML and uses modular 
programming techniques, it could easily be extended to provide 
CORBA support for other programming languages that can call C 
functions.  This could provide a quick solution for providing 
CORBA support to programming languages without the need to 
implement a new ORB or provide additional language bindings 
for an existing ORB.
