ML is a strongly-typed language, meaning that all values and 
variables have an associated type that can be determined at 
compile time. \cite{ullman} A value of one type may not be 
assigned to a variable of another type.  \cite{ullman} 
ML's strong typing is a valuable debugging aid, since it 
allows many errors to be caught by the compiler, rather 
than resulting in very mysterious errors when the program
is executed.  Although most other strongly typed languages 
require an explicit declaration of the type of every 
variable, ML will try to figure out the unique type of each    
variable and will only require a declaration for a variable 
when it is impossible to deduce its type.  \cite{ullman}
