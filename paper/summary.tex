We have designed and implemented an interface system (CORBin) 
to work with ORBit, a freely available ORB with C language 
bindings, in order to provide CORBA support for the functional 
language, ML. The interface system provides an IDL compiler, 
corbin-idl, that processes an Interface Definition Language 
(IDL) file and generates C functions which utilize the 
functionality provided by ORBit.  These C functions are 
added to a library that is compiled into the SML/NJ runtime 
system.  The resulting runtime system provides the ML programmer 
with the ability to implement and communicate with CORBA objects 
defined within the IDL file.  A case study was presented to 
illustrate the use of the CORBin System in the development of 
a distributed instant messaging application.   A performance
experiment was conducted to show that CORBA objects implemented
in ML using the CORBin System can achieve satisfactory performance
levels for operation execution.   The performance experiment compared
two different implementations of a CORBA object.  One version was 
implemented in C and another was implemented in ML using the CORBin
System.  The average execution times for the operations 
invoked by a client application were roughly the same for both 
implementations.  The source code for the CORBin System,
case study,  and performance test can be retrieved from
