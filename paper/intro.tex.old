In a world where the distributed computing environment is a cornerstone 
for millions of organizations, computer scientists continue to pursue new 
ways in which distributed applications can be developed rapidly and with ease.
This can be an ever challenging problem as organizations often have a need to 
utilize various computing platforms and programming languages.  Moreover, the 
desire to develop smaller, modularized components using object oriented design 
principles has caused a software development paradigm shift.  The creation of 
more general purpose software components has become preffered over monolithic 
application development. In order to deal with these challenges, several new 
distributed computing technologies have been introduced.  One of these such 
technologies is the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).  CORBA 
was developed by the Object Management Group (OMG).  The OMG is an open 
membership, not-for-profit consortium that produces and maintains computer 
industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications.    As of 
this writing, the OMG's membership roster includes about 800 of the largest 
companies in the computer industry.  One of the driving forces behind the 
creation of CORBA was the need for a high level of interoperability in a 
distributed environment.  In response to this, OMG introduced the Interface 
Definition Language (IDL) and the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP).  By 
defining a stardard interface for distributed objects in IDL, it is possible 
to interoperate with objects that could be implemented in different programming 
languages and that exist on different operating systems.  CORBA accomplishes 
this through the use of an Object Request Broker (ORB).
