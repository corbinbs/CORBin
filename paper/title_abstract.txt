Title:  "CORBin: A System Providing CORBA Support to 
                the Standard ML of New Jersey Compiler"

Abstract:

With the networked computing environment becoming more diverse, 
technologies like the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) 
are becoming widely used in an effort to create software components 
that can interoperate regardless of implementation and computing 
platform.  Since an Object Request Broker (ORB) is needed
to provide CORBA capability, some programming languages, like ML, 
have gone without CORBA support. 
Because ML provides powerful capabilities in certain problem domains,  
the ability to develop CORBA based software in ML is highly desirable.  
This paper describes the design and implementation of the C ORB Interface
System (CORBin) which provides CORBA support to the Standard ML of New Jersey 
(SML/NJ) compiler via an existing ORB with C language bindings called ORBit.  
A distributed instant messaging application is also presented to 
illustrate the use of CORBin with the SML/NJ compiler.
